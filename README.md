# IIFE-

This is an example of using IIFE(Immediately-invoked function expression) which is an immediately-invoked function expression that is called immediately after it is defined. Using an IIFE along with closures allows for a private scope which preserves privacy for variables defined within them. IIFE's are very useful because not only will it allow for a private scope it also minmizes the pollution of the global environment reducing the chances of name collisions occuring.
